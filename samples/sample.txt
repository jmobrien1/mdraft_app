Sample Document for mdraft Testing
This is a sample text file created for end-to-end validation.
It contains multiple lines of text that should be converted to Markdown.
The conversion process should preserve the content structure.
This document tests the complete workflow:
1. File upload to the web service
2. Background processing by the worker
3. Conversion to Markdown format
4. Download of the processed result
If you can read this, the validation script worked!
