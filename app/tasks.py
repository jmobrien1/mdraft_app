"""
Background task management for mdraft.

The mdraft MVP uses Google Cloud Tasks in production to offload
long‑running document conversions to worker services.  This module
provides a simplified interface that allows the same application code
to enqueue tasks locally using a thread pool executor.  The
`add_conversion_task` function will submit a job to the executor and
invoke the processing pipeline defined in `conversion.py`.

When running in production, this module can be extended to use the
google‑cloud‑tasks client library to enqueue HTTP tasks targeting the
worker service.  Parameters for the queue (project ID, queue ID,
location, etc.) should be read from environment variables via
os.environ, following the example in the blueprint.
