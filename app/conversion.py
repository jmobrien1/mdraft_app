"""
Document conversion pipeline for mdraft.

This module encapsulates the logic for converting uploaded documents
into Markdown using either an open source engine (markitdown) or
Google's Document AI for scanned files.  The MVP uses a simplified
stub implementation because external CLI tools and cloud APIs are not
available in this environment.  Functions defined here should log
meaningful messages to aid troubleshooting when integrated with
background workers.
